<b><i>What is ElastiSite?</i></b><br><br>

<b>1.:</b> A <b>framework</b>. That means: a software, which contains premade solutions, operational mechanisms for programmers, in order to not to develop those again.<br>
<br>
As e.g. car factories do not invent the shape and the material of the wheel for each and every type, they just redesign them, if it's needed for the new model.<br>
<br>
The framework determines the basic attributes and operational characteristics of the website, e.g.:<br>
- Speed<br>
- Security of the users' data stored by the website, in other words: the privacy level<br>
- The speed of producing a new website with the framework<br>
- The modernity of the website<br>
<br>
<i>In conclusion:</i><br>
<b><span style="color: #0c1a6f;"> The quality of the website is much more depending on the framework it was made by, than the person who is creating that. So: the basics are the most important, like in the case of a residential house.</b><br>
Naturally, the precise individual development process is also important, and affects the proper functionality.<br>
<br>

<b>2.:</b> 
A project with the purpose of filling the internet with fast, reliable and modern websites instead of slow, insecure and obsolete ones, 
and to disprove the false statement, that the good website requires a good marketing expert instead a good web developer.<br>
<br>

<b><i>I wholeheartedly recommend and ElastiSite to you, if</i></b><br>

- you consider that important to set word explanation to your articles easily<br>
- you want an easy and clear site administration interface for your contents<br>
- you believe in GDPR is not a necessary bad or unwanted regulation, but also you really need the best quality privacy<br>
